Minecraft Server Mod Folder
Hello Everyone,
Above shows a list of the mods we use on this server as well as a compressed 7Zip file of said mods.
Please feel free to view the mods and download the 7Zip file.
To install the mods navigate to %appdata%/.minecraft directory.
Locate the local mods folder and delete it.
Download the 7Zip file and extract it.
Take the newly extracted mods folder and move it to the %appdata%/.minecraft directory.
Launch Minecraft.
Navigate to the 3 horizontal bars which display Minecraft Launcher Settings.
Navigate to Launch Options.
Toggle the Advanced Settings so that they are turned on.
Select the Forge Launcher Option.
Toggle the JVM Arguments so that they are editable
Change the very first number you see in that line to 4. (I.E: -Xmx4G should be the first parameter in your argument)
This changes the amount of RAM Minecraft is allowed to use, AKA 4GB of RAM is what we found to be the most efficient for smooth gameplay.
Save.
Launch the Forge version.
Connect to our server and enjoy your stay! :)
